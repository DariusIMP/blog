Finally, I've got my own page! Here I'm going to write down about my professional experiences, my technical interests and other topics.

<!--more-->
It's been some time since I wanted to do this and now I find myself with enough bandwidth to fullfill this idea. I spend a lot of my time working on software engineering projects, having new experiences and learning new stuff everyday. Sometimes I ask myself if it's not worth sharing those interests with the rest of the world, and many times the answer I find to be yes, I just need a proper place to do so.
I think a blog is a great format which allows us to write with as much detail as we think it's necessary. Of course LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, etc, are great social media platforms, but over there we have different ways to communicate. 

# Who am I?

I'm a 29 years old software engineer from the University of Buenos Aires. I've got two nationalities as I'm Andorran and Argentinian. In fact I've lived most of my life in Andorra but I ended up migrating to Argentina in 2010, in order to have a different life experience. I have no regrets about that, it was worth it, although not easy at the very beginning but I ended up enjoying this place pretty much. 
Although, after all this many years, I think it's time to move forward looking for "new adventures" and that's why I'm migrating to Paris soon this year. 

That's my story, I'll be writing posts mainly in english, as I'd enjoy to be read by people from many places around the world, but evidently it's not the only language I'm fluent with, that's why sometimes I'll be writing content in Spanish and French (and why not even Catalan). 

# About this site

How can you build a site like this one for yourself? Well, it's actually quite simple. I'm using the [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) feature, using the [hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/) with the [hugo tranquilpeak theme](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme). 

I can write down a short tutorial with this if you ever ask me.

Once you have everything set up, you only need to set up your profile and start creating content.

# What's the photo above?

You might want to know where was that picture above this post taken. It's a place in the north of Argentina, in the province of Catamarca, specifically in the valley of Aconquija, near Tucuman. I use to go there during the summer as it's a great place to rest. I took that picture some months ago.
